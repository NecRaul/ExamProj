# ExamProj
I had a math teacher back in high school who tried to make an exam app that you could put questions/answers into and then randomize them to give to students. This is gonna be something of that sort.

I've already worked on a similar project before but because it's for commercial use I can't upload my work here so instead I decided on using this to showcase my skills/make my teacher happy.

## Dependencies
```
DevExpress.Win.Design
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
```

## DevExpress
If there's an issue regarding DevExpress during the initial build, use Project Converter to change version to fit your version.

### Why DevExpress?
The components look better than the default WinForms ones.

## To do list
* Decide/make an overall architecture of how everything is gonna work
* Grid form to delete or keep a list of the questions/answers
* CRUD form to create/update questions
* Exam form to actually exam the students
